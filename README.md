# Rat-Maze

Grade 12 Java project heavily revolving around the practice of recursion. This is the assignment described below:

## Assignment Description
Many experiments in psychology involve rats attempting to travel through a maze. To represent a
maze you shall use a rectangular array (8x12) in which the symbol `.` represents the path, `B`
represents the barrier, `C` the cheese, and `X` represents an exit. `R` or `M` should represent the Rat or Mouse. If the rat begins from a start position along the outside wall then this start position cannot be considered an exit. A typical maze is shown below.

```
B B B B B B B B B B B B
B . . . B . B . . . C B
B . B . B . B . B B B B
B . B . . . . . . . B B
B . B B B B . B B . B B
B R B . . . . . B . . B
B B B B B B B X B B B B
```

Your problem is, given a starting point in the maze, to find the cheese and then an exit point (if
possible). If the search for the cheese and an exit is successful, you must print the maze showing the
path (**the shortest path**) that has been found.
